How to run the project:

Goes to the project lib/ directory

run ruby main.rb

Follow the instruction: 'Please input the file path of your test data (eg. ../input): '

Input ../input as indicated in the given example

Then, it will output all results


Assumptions:

Ruby version - ruby 2.2.2
Ruby gemset - conference_track_management
External library - rspec

PS: test file 'input' contains extra information at the end of given test data for testing purpose



Design:

First, the project should be able to convert lines in the test file into Talk instances. Each line represent an instance of Talk
Second, computes total time of all Talk instances. Given some constraints of Track, now computes the number of tracks that are needed

Before adding talks to one track, the project should be able to select all possible talks with a given minutes
Then, adding selected talks with given minutes to a track

In order to ensure each track contains different talks, it is necessary to delete assigned talks of a track
after this track is created and assigned some talks

Finally, compute and print all tracks based on given constraints
